## Introduction

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

## Install the Developer Package

### Step 1. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, use a virtual environment. Skip this
   step only if you do want to install all dependencies globally.

Create virtual environment:

On Linux and macOS:
```sh
# Depending on your OS, this step may require installing python3-venv
python3 -m venv openvino_env
```

On Windows: 
```sh
python -m venv openvino_env
```

### Step 2. Activate Virtual Environment

On Linux and macOS:
```sh
source openvino_env/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```sh
openvino_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3. Set Up and Update PIP to the Highest Version

Run the command below:
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 4. Install the Package

Run the command below: <br>

   ```sh
   pip install openvino-dev
   ```

### Step 5. Verify that the Package is Installed

Run the command below (this may take a few seconds):
```sh
pot -h
```

You will see the help message for Post-Training Optimization Tool if installation finished successfully.

## Troubleshooting

#### Error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Build Tools for Visual Studio"

On Windows* some dependencies may require compilation from source when installing. To resolve this issue, you need to install [Build Tools for Visual Studio* 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) and repeat package installation.

#### ImportError: libpython3.7m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

To resolve missing external dependency on Ubuntu*, execute the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libpython3.7
```
